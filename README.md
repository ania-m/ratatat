Hi,

This is just a web app by Erhies to explore ruby on rails. Probably full of badly written code and stuff from [*Ruby on Rails Tutorial*](http://railstutorial.org/) by [Michael Hartl](http://michaelhartl.com/).

You can visit the app site by following this link [Ratatat](http://ratatat.herokuapp.com/).
